Bro, do you even write javascript?

## Features

You've got a deeply-nested set of objects that may or may not always be there.
We've all seen something like this:
`var myURL = app.config.environment.buildURL('dev');`
which leads to one of our favorite javascript errors...
`error: undefined is not a function`

And the solution only makes the code base ugly:
```
var myURL;
if (app && app.config && app.config.environment && app.config.environment.buildURL) {
    myURL = app.config.environment.buildURL('dev');
}
```

We all hate that, don't we?

So what if you could just type:
```
var myURL;
if (Bro(app).doYouEven('config.environment.buildURL')) {
    myURL = app.config.environment.buildURL('dev');
}
```

Or better yet, how about:
```
var myURL;
Bro(app).iDontAlways('config.environment.buildURL').butWhenIdo(function(val){
   myURL = val;
});
```

Well, now you can!
